Can you follow the code flow/layout? Absolutely.  Code is well written and is commented very well.

Can you understand the logic/reasoning for what it is doing?  Code makes sense, I could visualize what was happening as I was reading his code.

Could you build with (import and use) or extend on it (as a developer adding more to the codebase)?  It appears to be ready for use, also seems like there is room to branch out
and create more versatility.

Compliments: 
1.) Clear and concise code
2.) Extremely well commented.

Criticisms:
1.) Maybe instead of naming the files package0/1/3, it would be better named something like package, then update1,2 etc.
